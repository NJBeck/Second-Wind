#Second Wind

Just a start of a simple 2D in OpenGL mostly to practice some design principles.
So far I've only started with some data oriented for the few entity components I have.

A binary can be found in the /bin folder.

To compile you'll need to use VS because of SDL's libs.
And of course make sure the SDL2.dll is with the executable.
I've included a premake script to build for other buildtools as well.
